Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes. Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however. Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.
