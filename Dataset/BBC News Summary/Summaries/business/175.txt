5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth, figures revealed. The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3. Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January. But on a year-on-year basis, the sector still saw a sales increase of 6. Consumer spending fuelled France's economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy. "It's a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price," Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency. Meanwhile in Italy, consumer confidence rose to its highest level since October 2004.
