South Africa biggest retail bank Absa has said it is still in talks with UK bank Barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group. But the group said Barclays is still waiting for the approval of South Africa's banking and competition authorities to make a formal offer. "Discussions with Barclays are continuing, but shareholders are advised that no agreement has been reached as to any offer being made by Barclays to acquire a majority stake in Absa," Absa said in a statement. If Barclays buys a stake in Absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in South Africa in recent years. However, the company warned that headline earnings growth would be trimmed by about four percentage points because of share options for a black economic empowerment transaction and a staff share incentive scheme.
