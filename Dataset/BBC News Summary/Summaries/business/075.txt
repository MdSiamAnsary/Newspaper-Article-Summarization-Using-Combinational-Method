European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax. A levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world's poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. Global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting.
