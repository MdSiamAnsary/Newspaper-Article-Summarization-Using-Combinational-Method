A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada. A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. Now, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. "We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005," said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy. The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK.
