German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy. "We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock," said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. " Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure "a very mild decline". Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.
