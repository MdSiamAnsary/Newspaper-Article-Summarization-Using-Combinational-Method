The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling on the government to stem job losses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies. The TUC said in its submission before the Budget that action is needed because of 105,000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber called for "a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to the lives of working people. ""Greater investment in childcare strategies and the people delivering that childcare will increases the options available to working parents," he said.
