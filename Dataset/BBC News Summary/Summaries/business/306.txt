UK retail sales were better than expected in November as Christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the High Street, figures show. But the figures, along with this week's inflation report, could trigger another interest rate rise in the New Year. Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December. However, retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November's unexpected rise in sales, they say. Aggressive tactics, such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks & Spencer, appear to have paid off. "Price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn't grown as much as volumes," said Investec economist David Page.
