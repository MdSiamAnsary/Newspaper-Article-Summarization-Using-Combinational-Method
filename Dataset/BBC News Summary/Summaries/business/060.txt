Another three US insurance executives have pleaded guilty to fraud charges stemming from an ongoing investigation into industry malpractice. The investigation by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer has now obtained nine guilty pleas. The highest ranking executive pleading guilty on Tuesday was former Marsh senior vice president Joshua Bewlay. Mr Spitzer's investigation of the US insurance industry looked at whether companies rigged bids and fixed prices.
