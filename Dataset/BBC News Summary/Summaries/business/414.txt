Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168m (Â£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm. Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate America. "The settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible," William Lerach, the lawyer leading the class action suit against Enron, said. "Hopefully, this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties," he added. Under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of Enron's shareholders almost three years ago. However, the latest deal does not include former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.
