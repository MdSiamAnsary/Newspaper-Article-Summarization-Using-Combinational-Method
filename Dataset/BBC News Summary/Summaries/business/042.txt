Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51. The UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and "operating flaws" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. 30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.
