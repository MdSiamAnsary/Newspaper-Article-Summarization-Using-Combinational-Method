Shares in India's largest power producer, National Thermal Power Corp (NTPC) have risen 13% on their stock market debut. It was India's second $1bn stock debut in three months, coming after the flotation by software firm Tata. "It is a good investment bet," said Suhas Naik, an investment analyst from ING Mutual Fund. " Analysts say the success of the NTPC flotation would encourage the government to reduce stakes in more power companies. The firm is the largest utility company in India, and the sixth largest power producer in the world.
