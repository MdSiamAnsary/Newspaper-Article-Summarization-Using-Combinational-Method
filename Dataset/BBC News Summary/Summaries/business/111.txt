Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever is to merge its two management boards after reporting "unsatisfactory" earnings for 2004. The company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range. Under the restructuring plans, Patrick Cescau, the UK-based co-chairman, will become group chief executive. "We have recognised the need for greater clarity of leadership and we are moving to a simpler leadership structure that will provide a sharper operational focus," Mr Burgmans said. "We are leaving behind one of the key features of Unilever's governance but this is a natural development following the changes introduced last year. " The company, which has had dual headquarters in Rotterdam and London since 1930, will announce the location of its head office at a later date. Oil giant Shell last year dismantled its dual-ownership structure, after a series of problems relating to the size of its oil reserves that hammered its share price and led to the resignation of key board members. "The best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification," said Arjan Sweere, an analyst at Petercam. "While it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share," said Mr Cescau. "We let a range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment. 8% last year, dragged down by below part sales at its beverage division, where revenues dipped by almost 4%. Sales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3. In Asia, leading products came under "attack" from rivals such as Procter & Gamble. Sales of Slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the Atkins diet.
