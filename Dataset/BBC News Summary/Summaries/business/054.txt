South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. South Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. "We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors," chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.
