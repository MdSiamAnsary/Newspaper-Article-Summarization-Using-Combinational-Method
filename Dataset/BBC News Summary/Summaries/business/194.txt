UK mortgage lending showed a "post-Christmas lull" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said. Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply. Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by £4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the £5. This was a return to the "weaker pattern" of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added. The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29% and 18% lower year-on-year respectively. "These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market," Peter Williams, CML deputy director, said.
