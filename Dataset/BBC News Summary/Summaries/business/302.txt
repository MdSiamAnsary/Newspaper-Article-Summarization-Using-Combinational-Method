A slimming aid made from a southern African cactus is set to be developed by UK firm Phytopharm and Unilever. Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever will help the pharmaceutical firm develop the snacks containing Hoodia extract. The plant, licensed to Phytopharm in 1997, has been used for thousands of years by the Sans bushmen of the Kalahari desert to stave off hunger. 5m from Unilever - out of a potential total of Â£21m - as well as future royalties on product sales. Under the deal, production of the Hoodia cactus at Phytopharm's nursery in South Africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions, said Phytopharm chief executive Richard Dixey. The firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from Hoodia with Pfizer.
