Argentine President Nestor Kirchner and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez signed the deal in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. Last April, Argentina signed a $240m agreement to import Venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now been extended. Last year, Argentina's severe energy crisis forced President Kirchner to suspend gas exports to Chile. The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa. President Chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a South American oil company, which could include the state-owned companies of Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia.
