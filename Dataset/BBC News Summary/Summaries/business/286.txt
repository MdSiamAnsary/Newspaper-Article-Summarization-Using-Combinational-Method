China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11. 4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7. 3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. "There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005," said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings. China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China's currency. 28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness.
