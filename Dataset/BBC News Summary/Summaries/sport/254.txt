Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club. But chairman John Wardle said: "I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. " Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. "If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. " Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. "He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club. " City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window.
