Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005. The 2003 French Open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return. "I don't know when it is going to happen," Ferrero told BBC Sport. "But I have a lot of confidence in me that I will be the same Juan Carlos as I was before, and very soon. " The 25-year-old Spaniard joins a top field for the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in 2005. He opens against Rainer Schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed David Nalbandian in the second round. "I had to play against Joachim Johansson in the first round last week in Marseille. "In the past when I was a top seed I would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals. " Despite this, Ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season. "The difficult moments were when I knew that I had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover.
