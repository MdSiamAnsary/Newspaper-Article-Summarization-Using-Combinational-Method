Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer. He had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. I lost because of the things I did," said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. "I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race. " Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday's Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd," Greene said.
