The ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. Wolves chairman Rick Hayward said: "We're delighted Glenn is here. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. "I saw the massive potential that Wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the Premiership parallels my ambitions. " Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey defended the decision to give Hoddle a short-term contract. "For somebody of Glenn's calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line, it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here. "Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday.
