Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series. Such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the Northern Irish FA, Howard Wells, at the next meeting of the four home countries. The English FA has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. But Smith said: "Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed. " The Home International series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional Scotland-England fixture continuing until 1989. "The Scotland v England match was a highlight of the end of the season," he added.
