Hong Kong is hoping to join Japan as co-host of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. But Hong Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) chairman John Molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and a quarter-final. " Japan faces stiff competition in the form of South Africa and New Zealand to host the event in seven years' time. "Until now, the World Cup has been held in countries from the Six Nations or Tri-Nations," said Tokumasu. " Tokumasu added that the 2002 football World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, had been a huge success. Last year, Japan launched its first professional rugby league and it has the fourth largest number of registered players (125,508) in the world after England, South Africa and France.
