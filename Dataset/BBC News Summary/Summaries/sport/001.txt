British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid. " Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot. For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March.
