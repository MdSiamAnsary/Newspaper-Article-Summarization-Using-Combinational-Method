Arsenal's Edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed Manchester United's win over the Gunners. The Brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. "I saw people being pulled apart, people pushing, pointing and shouting," he told Uefa's official website. " However, Edu tried to play down the incidents, adding: "There was nothing that I haven't seen in Brazilian derbies. " But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of United's challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes.
