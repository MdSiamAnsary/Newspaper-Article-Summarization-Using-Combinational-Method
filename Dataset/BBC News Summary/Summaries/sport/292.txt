Mike Ruddock paid tribute to his Wales side after they came from 15-6 down to beat France 24-18 in the Six Nations. "After going two tries down in 12 minutes we had to show character," said the national team coach. "I didn't have to tell them anything at half-time because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before. " Man-of-the-match Stephen Jones, who kicked three penalties, a drop goal and conversion, was ecstatic following after the win at Stade de France. Two years ago we didn't win a single game in the Six Nations. " Double try scorer Martyn Williams was keen not to talk about a possible Grand Slam for Wales. "There's no mention of a Grand Slam among the players. We've got a tough game against Scotland at Murrayfield.
