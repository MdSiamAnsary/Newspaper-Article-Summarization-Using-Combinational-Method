Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is lining up a summer move for England and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen. "Michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we're monitoring him," he told BBC Newcastle. He believes the prospect of breaking Jackie Milburn's club scoring record may influence the striker's decision. Milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while Shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. "I can't imagine him leaving without breaking Jackie Milburn's scoring record. " Souness also revealed he tried to bring back Nolberto Solano during the January transfer window.
