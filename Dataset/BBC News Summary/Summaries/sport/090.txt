Jason Gardener says being made an MBE in the New Year Honours List underlines the achievement of Great Britain's 4x100m relay squad at the Olympics. Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis have all been awarded MBEs after beating pre-race favourites USA to gold. The British sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the Americans. And when the USA stumbled with a poor switch between Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller at the 300m stage, Britain edged ahead going into the final bend. Then, on cue, Lewis-Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38. "Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far," said the Birchfield Harrier. "Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal. "It gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something. "- There was also recognition for James Clarke, chairman of the London Marathon.
