Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. " Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: "I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all. " Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. If the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday.
