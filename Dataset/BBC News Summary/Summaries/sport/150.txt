Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side. "Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried. " Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: "Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult. " However, he added that his side, who are four places above the Magpies in the Premiership, were "not afraid of anyone". Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match. "They're on a high, but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win," he said. He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. "We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come.
