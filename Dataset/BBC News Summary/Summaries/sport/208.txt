Graeme Souness believes Walter Smith would be the perfect choice to succeed Berti Vogts as Scotland manager. The Scottish Football Association has appointed Tommy Burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November. "He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football. " Souness added: "Walter is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox. " Souness joined Sir Alex Ferguson in backing Smith's claims. The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity. "You need somebody who knows what they're doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job. " The Man Utd boss continued: "I don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. "He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smith's long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up.
