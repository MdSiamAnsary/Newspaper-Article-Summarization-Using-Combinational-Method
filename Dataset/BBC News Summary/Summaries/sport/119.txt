Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil. Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. And it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts. The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers. John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary. It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson. But you have got to remember Sven-Goran Eriksson's side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played.
