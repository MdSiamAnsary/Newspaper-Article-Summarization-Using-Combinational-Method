Former France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland. Sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half Yann Delaigue in the RBS Six Nations to date. " The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season. With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. "The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time," said Sella. " Sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire Laporte, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. "This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup," said Sella, "which Laporte is doing very well. "But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. It may not seem good now that we're not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we're world champions. "The majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. " France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March.
