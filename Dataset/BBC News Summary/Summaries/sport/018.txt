Teenager LaShawn Merritt ran the third fastest indoor 400m of all time at the Fayetteville Invitational meeting. Kenyan Bernard Lagat missed out on the world record by 1. 45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat Canada's Nate Brannen by almost 10secs. The Olympic silver medallist's time of three minutes 49. 89secs was inferior only to the 1997 world record of Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj and former world record holder Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland's 3:49. Lagat was on course to break El Guerrouj's record through 1200m but could not maintain the pace over the final 400m. Cragg, who recently defeated Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele in Boston, held off Bekele's Ethiopian colleague Markos Geneti by only 0. Mark Carroll, who will join Cragg in the European Indoor Championships next month, finished a solid third in 7:46. Olympic 200m gold medallistof Jamaica ran the fastest women's 60m in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of 7.
