Tottenham manager Jacques Santini has resigned for "personal reasons". The former France manager moved to White Hart Lane this summer but now wants to return to France. Santini said: "My time at Tottenham has been memorable and it is with deep regret that I take my leave. "Private issues in my personal life have arisen which caused my decision. " He added: "I should like to thank (sporting director) Frank Arnesen and (chairman) Daniel Levy for their understanding. " Assistant coach Martin Jol has been put in temporary charge and will take care of team affairs for Saturday's Premiership match against Charlton.
