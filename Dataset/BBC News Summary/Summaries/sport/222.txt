Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with European football after the 2-0 Uefa Cup win against Lazio. Boro, who are playing in Europe for the first time in their 128-year history, are top of Group E with maximum points. " Before the match, McClaren had said that a win over the Italian giants would put Boro firmly on the European footballing map. For the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake. McClaren's only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals. "But I had watched Lazio in recent weeks and I saw them score a late equaliser against Inter Milan on Saturday so I knew we needed a second goal. " Middlesbrough forward Boudewijn Zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals. " The Holland international said Boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games. "We've got a very good feeling, there is a good spirit, all the lads work hard for each other and it's a squad of friendly players, which I think you can see on the pitch," he added.
