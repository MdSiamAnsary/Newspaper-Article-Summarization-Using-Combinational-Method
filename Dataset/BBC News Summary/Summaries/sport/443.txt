Tennis star Kim Clijsters will make her return from a career-threatening injury at the Antwerp WTA event in February. "Kim had considered returning to action in Paris on 7 February," a statement on her website said. Back then, a doctor treating the Belgian feared that her career may be over, with the player having already endured an operation earlier in the season to cure her wrist problem. Clijsters was also due to marry fellow tennis star Lleyton Hewitt in February but the pair split "for private reasons" back in October.
