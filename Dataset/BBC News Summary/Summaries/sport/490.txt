Newly-crowned Australian Open champion Marat Safin has ruled out any chance of winning Wimbledon in the future. After losing in round one last year, Safin said he had "given up" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind. "I'll play, but with no expectations. I feel like I can't waste my time, my energy on that surface," he said. "Some people, they cannot play on clay. Some people, they cannot play on a hard court. " However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles. Two grand slams, it's already something. "Basically, I would love to win a couple more. I think I have a chance if I continue this way. "If (coach) Peter Lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, I think I can make it. " The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals. Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam.
