Dundee United manager Ian McCall has won a reprieve from the sack, with chairman Eddie Thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future. It is understood that McCall would have been sacked if Sheffield Wednesday manager Paul Sturrock had been willing to return to Tannadice. "Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup," he added. "The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only. "Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw. "All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved. " Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their side's 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South. "On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One. "I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you've done that kind of thing, it's the result you look for.
