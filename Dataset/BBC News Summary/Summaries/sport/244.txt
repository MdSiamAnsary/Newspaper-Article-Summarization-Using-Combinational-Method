Joint assistant boss Stuart Pearce has admitted he would like to succeed Kevin Keegan as manager at Manchester City. "You don't have to be Einstein to realise there will be a manager's job available at a really good club," Pearce told BBC GMR. " Pearce initially joined City as a player under Keegan in 2001 before becoming part of the coaching staff. The former England defender had a year as player-boss with Nottingham Forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job. He added: "By that time, I will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being Kevin's successor.
