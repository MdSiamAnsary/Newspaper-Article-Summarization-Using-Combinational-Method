Liverpool and Millwall have been charged by the Football Association over crowd trouble during their Carling Cup match on 26 October. During the match at Millwall's new Den Stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. Liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the Hillsborough disaster, where 96 supporters were crushed to death in April 1989. He has said CCTV footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a Liverpool fan attacking a Millwall fan in the west stand. They have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch.
