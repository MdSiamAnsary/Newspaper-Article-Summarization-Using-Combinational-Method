Sonia O'Sullivan will seek to regain her title at the Bupa Great Ireland Run on 9 April in Dublin. "I understand she's had a solid winter's training down in Australia after recovering from a minor injury," said race director Matthew Turnbull. Mark Carroll, Irish record holder at 3km, 5km and 10km, will make his debut in the mass participation 10km race.
