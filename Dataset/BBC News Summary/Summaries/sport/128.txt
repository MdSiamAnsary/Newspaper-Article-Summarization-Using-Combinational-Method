Scotland manager Walter Smith says he wants to restore the national team's respectability in world football. While qualification for the 2006 World Cup appears to be beyond Scotland, Smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive. " Smith, meeting a number of his squad for the first time, brought them together on Monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation's fortunes. "This is a relaxed gathering and I don't think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists. " A 25-man squad will spend the next three days based at the Mottram Hall hotel in Cheshire and will train at Manchester United's nearby Carrington complex.
