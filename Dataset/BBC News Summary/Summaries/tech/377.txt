The makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California. From 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer.
