New owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames. Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run.
