The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for "security reasons". The policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush. Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said: "The measure was taken for security reasons. The barring of non-US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. In early October a so-called "denial of service" attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs. About the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name. There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site. Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site. com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney have failed. By contrast Netcraft's four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems. Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack.
