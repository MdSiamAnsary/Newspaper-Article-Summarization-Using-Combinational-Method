Some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern Asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs. Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders. But in the wake of Sunday's tsunami, Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears. One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi. With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka. " Soon, thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read Morquendi's first hand accounts. In one message, Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. " Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendi's text message blogs was palpable. "I can't even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports, and doing the relief work at the same time. "Others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. Dina Mehta is an Indian blogger who's helping with the newly created South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog. "Anyone who says, OK, I want to come and do some work in India, volunteer in India, or in Sri Lanka or Malaysia, this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines, relief agencies, aid agencies, contacts for them etc. "Ms Mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. "All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends. " News spreads quickly on weblogs, a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. In Sri Lanka, blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help.
