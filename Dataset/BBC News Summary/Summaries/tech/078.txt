The survey, conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year. Blogs, or web logs, are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts, opinions or spread news events in their own words. Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs. The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information, with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators. The aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. Just under one in 10 of the US's internet users read political blogs such as the Daily Kos or Instapundit during the US presidential campaign. Blog creators were likely to be young, well-educated, net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations, the survey found.
