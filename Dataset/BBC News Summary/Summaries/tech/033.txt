The World Bank questioned a United Nation's campaign to increase usage and access to technology in poorer nations. But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real. The report's figures surpass a WSIS campaign goal that calls for 50% access to telephones by 2015. "Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobile networks]," the report said. "A spokesman for the World Summit for the Information Society (WSIS), which is meeting this week in Geneva, told the BBC News website: "The digital divide is very much real and needs to be addressed. " On Tuesday, a meeting of the WSIS in Geneva agreed to the creation of a Digital Solitary Fund. Under the proposals agreed, voluntary contribution of 1% on contracts obtained by private technology service providers could be made to the Digital Solidarity Fund. Sixty percent of resources collected by the fund will be made available for projects in least developed countries, 30% for projects in developing countries, and 10% for projects in developed countries.
