The company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. The original iPod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. But analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the iTunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, told the BBC News website that Apple had done a good job in "sealing off the market from competition" so far. Its second-generation models, like the Creative Zen Micro Photo, is due out in the summer. Digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans, according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004, according to the record industry, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months. The IFPI industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. Analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. Some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute DIY radio shows, called podcasts. According to Mr McGuire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like iPods and Creative Zens.
