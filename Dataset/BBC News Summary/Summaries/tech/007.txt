Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through. Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.
