Oasis singer Liam Gallagher has been fined 50,000 euros (Â£35,000) after a fight in a German hotel two years ago. Gallagher was arrested along with drummer Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage after the brawl in Munich in December 2002. But police said Gallagher kicked an officer in the chest and had large amounts of alcohol and drugs - possibly cocaine - in his blood. "The process has stopped by paying 50,000 euros," said Anton Winkler, spokesman for the Munich prosecutor. The fight continued outside, where "one of the officers was kicked in the chest with full force by Liam Gallagher.
