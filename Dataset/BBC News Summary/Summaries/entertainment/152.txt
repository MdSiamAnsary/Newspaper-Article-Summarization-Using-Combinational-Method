Four suits worn by the Beatles on their Please Please Me album cover have sold for $110,00 (Â£59,000) at a US auction. But some of Elvis Presley's earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - failed to sell at the Bonhams and Butterfields two-day sale. Auction spokesman Erik Simon said the Presley tapes were withdrawn because "they did not meet the minimum price set by the owners". He said the family of sound engineer Thorne Nogar did not want to divulge the price they had set or the offers they had received. The "pre-masters" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and Mr Nogar. Mr Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes could only be sold for "personal enjoyment" and cannot be copied for commercial gain.
