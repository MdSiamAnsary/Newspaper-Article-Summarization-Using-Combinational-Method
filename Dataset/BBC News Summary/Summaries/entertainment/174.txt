Judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne are in discussions to sign up for the new series. Last Saturday's show was beaten in the ratings by the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. The Pop Idol-style show votes off a group or contestant every week - the two that receive the lowest public vote have to perform a second time before the judges make a final decision. Rowetta Satchell, Steve Brookstein, Tabby Callaghan and group G4 are the remaining finalists. ITV's controller of entertainment, Claudia Rosencrantz, said she had no hesitation in recommissioning the show.
