The guitarist with US rock band Korn has quit the music business, saying he made the decision after experiencing a religious awakening. Brian 'Head' Welch told a radio station in California that his bandmates respected his decision to leave. The 34-year-old made reference to the band's aggressive brand of music and its young fans in his parting statement. "Anger is a good thing, and if kids want to listen to Korn, good, but there's happiness after the anger," he told his local radio station in Bakersfield.
