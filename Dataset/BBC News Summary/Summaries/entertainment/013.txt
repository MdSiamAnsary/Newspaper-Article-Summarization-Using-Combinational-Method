Orange Prize winner Andrea Levy has seen her book Small Island win the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award. Geraldine McCaughrean has picked up the children's fiction award for the third time for Not the End of the World. All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a Â£25,000 prize. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: "It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. "In the biography category it was John Guy's The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003.
