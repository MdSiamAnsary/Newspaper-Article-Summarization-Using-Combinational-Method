The changes come as part of a shake-up of several departments to create shows that appeal to a wider range of people. Director of television Jana Bennett said the changes were about "getting the best ideas on screen as efficiently and effectively as we can". The new person will be in charge of the Â£9m budget and their role will be to develop shows outside the capital, both within the BBC and with independent production companies. Jane Lush, controller of entertainment commissioning, said, "Entertainment and comedy are incredibly important to our audiences; I'm confident these changes will help us get the very best programmes on screen. " Similar positions will also be created in the other departments, with the new commissioning editor for documentaries based in Bristol and the daytime commissioning editor in Birmingham.
