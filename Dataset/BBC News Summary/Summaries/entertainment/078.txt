Clint Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby has become the new favourite to win best picture at the Oscars on Sunday. Its star Hilary Swank is favourite to win best actress while Jamie Foxx is tipped to win best actor for Ray. The Aviator has scored a best director nomination for Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, while stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both nominated for acting Oscars. "If you look at the Oscars race, The Aviator should be ahead," said awards pundit Tom O'Neil. People feel emotionally about it and Clint is a beloved Hollywood chum of the Academy voters," he said. Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was "heart-wrenching". "In the acting categories, Foxx is regarded as almost unbeatable for his performance as Ray Charles in Ray. " Hilary Swank is the favourite to win best actress for the second time in six years.
