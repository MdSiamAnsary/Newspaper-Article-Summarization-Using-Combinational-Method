Hollywood star Tom Hanks was in London's Leicester Square for the UK premiere of Polar Express. The West End landmark was turned into a festive landscape complete with snow and carol singers to celebrate the arrival of the animated film. Polar Express is based on a children's book which tells the story of a young boy's journey to meet Santa Claus. Hundreds of fans greeted the star, all wearing Santa hats, and mince pies were on offer. The "performance capture" technique enables Hanks to play a number of roles, including the eight-year-old boy who is at the centre of the story, and Father Christmas.
