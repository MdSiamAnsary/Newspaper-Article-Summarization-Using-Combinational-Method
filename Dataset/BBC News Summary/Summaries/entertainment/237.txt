Knight and drum 'n' bass star Roni Size have released No More in a bid to reduce gun use among young people. Size, whose New Forms album won the 1997 Mercury Music Prize, said gun use was "nothing to be glamorised". There were more than 10,500 firearms offences and 70 gun crime deaths in England and Wales between June 2003 and 2004, according to Home Office figures. Knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in Aston, near Knight's Birmingham home. Size became involved after two friends, Donna Small and Asha Jama, were shot in his Bristol hometown in October.
