The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available. 5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. " "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. " Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina. " New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
