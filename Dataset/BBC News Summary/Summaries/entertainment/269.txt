Singer George Michael has said that a new film about his life is the start of a retirement from public view. The pop star said it would be a much more "behind the scenes affair", and called his own genre of music "dead". The film, A Different Story, chronicles Michael's life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles. He hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry, and said: "I don't really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with. " Michael said that the film, directed by Southan Morris, would put his two decades of fame into context. The documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze, from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo Wham.
