Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen's Saturday night entertainment show Passport to Paradise will not return to screens, the BBC has said. The ex-Big Breakfast presenters were recruited to host the BBC One family variety show last July. Passport to Paradise involved a combination of games and outside broadcasts with a high level of audience participation. The BBC spokeswoman said Graham Norton's Strictly Dance Fever would be a priority for 2005.
