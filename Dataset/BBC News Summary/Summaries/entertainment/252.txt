Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars is being sued by his ex-girlfriend for $10 million (Â£5. The woman, Robin Mantooth, said Mars promised her repeatedly that he would provide financial support in the event of the couple breaking up. She is asking a Los Angeles court to award her half the musician's property, a monthly allowance and damages. Mantooth added that the pair became lovers in 1990, after which she abandoned her career as a documentary film-maker to move in with the guitarist at his Malibu home. They are embarking on a world tour later this year which will take in 60 cities across the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.
