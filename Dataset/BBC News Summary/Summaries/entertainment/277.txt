The original stage production of The Sound of Music is to be performed for the first time in the Austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released. Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the Rogers and Hammerstein classic set in the Alpine country. The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938. Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. Another source of irritation for Austrians is the song Edelweiss, which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers.
