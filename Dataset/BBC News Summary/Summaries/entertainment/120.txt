To mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star Bob Marley, Rob Partridge - Marley's former head of press at Island Records - remembers the man behind the legend. Partridge worked with Marley from 1977 until the Jamaican musician's death in 1981. : "I joined Island Records in 1977 and the first week I was there I worked on his show at the Rainbow Theatre. ": The album Exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status. I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts. ": Bob was one of the most mesmeric people I've ever had the privilege to work with. At the risk of stating the obvious, he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest I've ever seen. ": "I recall in 1978 he came to the UK for Top of the Pops and a Daily Mirror journalist did a half-hour interview. He came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a World Cup match on TV. I arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in Fulham. We played in Brazil against some World Cup-winning players. But Bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in America and the Third World. "In 1991, ten years after his death, he sold more records than at any time during his life. "We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time. ": "Bob, in worldwide terms, is the greatest music star there has ever been. If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere, in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldn't be. "No disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest, the best and the most influential artist in popular music. ": Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder.
