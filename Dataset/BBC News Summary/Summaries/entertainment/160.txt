Ipod owners can now download the Band Aid single from iTunes after Apple reached agreement with the charity. Apple had been unwilling to raise the cost of the single in line with other download services, said Band Aid. But the single is now on sale for 79p - the usual cost of a song from iTunes - with Apple donating a further 70p to the charity for each song downloaded. More than 72,000 copies of the new Band Aid single were sold on its first day of release on Monday, according to sales figures. Dido, Robbie Williams and Chris Martin are among those featured on the new version of Do They Know It's Christmas.
