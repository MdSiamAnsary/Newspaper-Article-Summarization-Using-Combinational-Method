Aaron Foster and David Treacy have won the right to take part in a tournament offering $1m in total prize money. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Some pro-players are winning a spot at the tour destinations through qualifying events organised by CPL partners. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UK's Four-Kings gaming clan. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK's top players of the PC game. The best eight players met face-to-face in a special elimination event in late December where Mr Foster and Mr Tracey proved their prowess at Painkiller. As part of their prize the pair also get a contract with Four-Kings Intel which is one of the UK's few pro-gaming teams. "There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport," said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel.
