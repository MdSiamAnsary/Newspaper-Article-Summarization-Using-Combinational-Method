0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be "the most accessible browser on the market", according to its authors. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. "Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone," said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. "Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. "People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor.
