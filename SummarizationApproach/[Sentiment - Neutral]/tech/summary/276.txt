Video game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world. EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Gerhard Florin, EA's managing director for European publishing, said: "Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science. " Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion. " Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. ""You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it," he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2. Jan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. "One idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show'," said Mr Bolz. He also said EA was planning an international awards show "similar to the Oscars and the Grammys" which would combine video games, music and movies. "People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them. "There's an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games.
