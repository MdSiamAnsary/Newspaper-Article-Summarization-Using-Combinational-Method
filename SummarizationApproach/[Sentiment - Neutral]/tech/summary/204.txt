Broadband wireless connectivity will be made available in the eleven reading rooms, the auditorium, caf&#233;, restaurant, and outdoor Piazza area. The technology has been on trial since May and usage levels make the Library London's most active public hotspot. "At the British Library we are continually exploring ways in which technology can help us to improve services to our users," said Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library. "Surveys we conducted recently confirmed that, alongside the materials they consult here, our users want to be able to access the internet when they are at the Library for research or to communicate with colleagues," she said. The study, conducted by consultancy Building Zones, found that 16% of visitors came to the Library to sit down and use it as a business centre. The study also found that people were spending an average of six hours in the building, making it an ideal wireless hotspot. The majority of visitors wanted to be able to access their e-mail as well as the British Library catalogue. People come to view resources which include the world's largest collection of patents and the UK's most extensive collection of science, technology and medical information.
