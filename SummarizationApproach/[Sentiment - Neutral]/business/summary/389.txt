An Investment Ministry official has told the Reuters news agency that the Bank of Alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005. Nevertheless, the Egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria. The announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of Egypt's privatisation programme. The appointment of Mahmoud Mohieldin, a reform-minded technocrat, to the new post of investment minister in July was taken as a sign that more sell-offs were on the way. Both the IMF and World Bank have urged Egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy.
