Car manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004. New vehicle sales jumped 22% to 449,603 from a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said. During 2004 "South Africa was one of the best performing markets internationally" for car sales, NAAMSA said. However, the world auto market has its problems and analysts warn that overcapacity and the strength of the rand could hit exports.
