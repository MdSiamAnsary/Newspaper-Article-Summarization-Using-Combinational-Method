Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges. The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. "The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable," said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds.
