An employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba's allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal. A spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as "very disappointing", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill's procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of "laddish culture" at the bank. "Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work. "Based in London's financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill's global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrill's most important customers. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.
