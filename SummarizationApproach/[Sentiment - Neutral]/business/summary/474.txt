Shares in Australian budget airline Virgin Blue plunged 20% after it warned of a steep fall in full year profits. Virgin Blue said profits after tax for the year to March would be between 10% to 15% lower than the previous year. "Sluggish demand reported previously for November and now December 2004 continues," said Virgin Blue chief executive Brett Godfrey. Virgin Blue reported a 22% fall in first quarter profits in August 2004 due to tough competition. Virgin Blue was launched four years ago and now has roughly one third of Australia's domestic airline market.
