Traders at US banking giant Citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in Germany over a controversial bond deal. The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation. "We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved," Citigroup said. Germany's financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor. " "We found clues of possible market manipulation," the spokeswoman said, which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on 2 August. "Germany's Securities Trading Act says that if BaFin finds such clues, it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor. Its private banking operation in Japan was closed down by regulators in Tokyo after an "aggressive sales culture" led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.
