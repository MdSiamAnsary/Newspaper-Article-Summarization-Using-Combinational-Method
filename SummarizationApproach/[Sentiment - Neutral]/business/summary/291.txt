US tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (Â£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Charles A Blixt, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, said the ruling "dramatically transforms" the government's lawsuit. Altria Group said, in a statement, the government now "must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future. "The government had claimed tobacco firms - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction  - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns  - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary. They brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. Judge David Sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. "We hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case," he wrote.
