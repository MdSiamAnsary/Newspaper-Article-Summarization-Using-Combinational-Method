The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. "It was a respectable report," said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities. "Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment. " "Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track. " That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. "Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York.
