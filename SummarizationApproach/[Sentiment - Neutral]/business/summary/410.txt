1% more cars in 2004 than in the previous year, as solid Chrysler sales offset a weak showing for Mercedes. 9 million units worldwide during 2004, the company said at the Detroit Motor Show. A switch to new models hit luxury marque Mercedes-Benz, with sales down 3. Chrysler avoided the fate of US rivals Ford and General Motors, both of whom lost ground to Japanese firms. Similarly on the up was the Smart brand of compact cars, with the division's sales jumping by 21. The future of the brand - which is controlled by the Mercedes group within DaimlerChrysler - remains in question, however. Smart has consistently lost money since it started trading in 1998, and new model launches are now "on hold", said Mercedes chief executive Eckhard Cordes.
