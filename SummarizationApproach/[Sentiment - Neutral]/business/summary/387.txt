German unemployment rose for the 11th consecutive month in December - making the year's average jobless total the highest since reunification. Allowing for changes in calculating statistics, the average number of people out of work was the highest since 1990 - or a rate of 10. The increase "was due primarily to the onstart of winter", labour office chief Frank-Juergen Weise said. News of the rise came as government welfare reforms came into force, a move that is expected to see unemployment swell still further in coming months. Under the Hartz IV changes, the previous two tier system of benefits and support for the long term unemployed has been replaced with one flat-rate payout. In turn, that means more people will be classified as looking for work, driving official figures higher. "Be prepared for a nasty figure for January 2005, about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis," warned HVB Group economist Andreas Rees. "I don't expect a strong and lasting turnaround until 2006," German Economy minister Wolfgang Clement said. Europe's biggest economy has been too weak to create work as it struggles to shake off three years of economic stagnation.
