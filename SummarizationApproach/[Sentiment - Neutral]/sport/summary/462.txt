Martina Navratilova has defended her decision to prolong her tennis career at the age of 48. "Women's tennis is really strong," she said, dismissing suggestions that the fact she could still win reflected badly on the women's game. " Navratilova has won three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles since she came out of retirement. Navratilova will partner Nathalie Dechy in the doubles event at the Uncle Toby's Hardcourts tournament on Australia's Gold Coast, which begins on Sunday. She will then link up with Daniela Hantuchova for the Australian Open doubles, and play in the mixed doubles with Leander Paes.
