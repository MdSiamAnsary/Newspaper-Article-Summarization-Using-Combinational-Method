Actor Michael Douglas is to co-produce and star in an adventure film about a diamond robbery set in India. Aishwarya Rai, star of Bride and Prejudice, is the "preferred choice" of the Indian studio involved in the film. The actor's own production company, Further Films, is working in partnership with two Indian film-making concerns to bring the picture to the screen. Shailendra Singh, the founder of India's Percept Films, said there would be "a lot of India" in the movie - and that an Indian train would play a big role. Swashbuckling adventure film Romancing The Stone saw Douglas's female co-star Kathleen Turner win a Golden Globe award for her performance in 1985.
