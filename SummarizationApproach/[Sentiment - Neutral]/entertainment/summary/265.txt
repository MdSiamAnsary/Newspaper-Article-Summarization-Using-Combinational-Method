The original stars of Swedish pop quartet Abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical Mamma Mia. It is the first time in almost 20 years that the four, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, have met publicly. Fans camped outside Stockholm's Cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. Original Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt. The musical, set on a small Greek island, tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. There are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide, including New York and London, with road shows in Toronto, South Korea and Madrid.
