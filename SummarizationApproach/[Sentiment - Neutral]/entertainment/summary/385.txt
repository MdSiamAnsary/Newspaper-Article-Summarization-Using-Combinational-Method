Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of The Hobbit. Jackson, who is currently filming a remake of Hollywood classic King Kong, said he thought that the sale of MGM studios to the Sony Corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project. The film-maker recently sued film company New Line Cinema for undisclosed damages over alleged withheld profits and lost revenue from the first part of the Middle Earth trilogy. Jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake King Kong, which is currently in production in Wellington. Jackson has also committed to making a film version of Lovely Bones, based on the best-selling book by Alice Sebold.
