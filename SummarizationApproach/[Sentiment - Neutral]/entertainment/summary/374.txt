Comic book veteran Stan Lee is to team up with producer Robert Evans to create a movie featuring a new superhero. Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films. He is collaborating on the script with screenwriter Peter Briggs, who penned the recent comic book adaptation Hellboy. "We believe it to be truly a whole new franchise," said Gill Champion, president and chief executive of Lee's POW. "In this world where people are looking for something different, Stan's idea was to create a concept not seen before to become an evergreen franchise for Paramount. However, the Spider-Man series has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.
