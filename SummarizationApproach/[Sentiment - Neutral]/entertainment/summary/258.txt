Singer Courtney Love has been spared jail for assault and drug offences, but must serve three years probation. She had back-to-back court appearances in two separate cases in Los Angeles, first pleading no contest to attacking a woman with a whisky bottle. The ex-Hole singer's lawyer Howard Weitzman said Ms Love had "turned her life around" and she was "clean and sober". The assault charge stemmed from April 2004, when Ms Love found musician Kristin King in her boyfriend's home. Judge Rand Rubin said she must:- Spend three years on probation  - Have one year's anger management counselling  - Have one year's drug rehabilitation  - Do 100 hours community service  - Pay $1,000 (Â£535) fine  - Have random drug tests  - Go to three Narcotics Anonymous meetings per weekIn the drugs case, she was sentenced to 18 months probation, to run concurrently with the probation for the assault. In a separate case relating to the same incident, Ms Love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates.
