The low-budget horror film Boogeyman has knocked Robert de Niro thriller Hide and Seek from the top spot at the UK box office. Hide And Seek, which was knocked off the top of the US box office by Boogeyman last month, fell one place. The film, which scored Oscar nominations for Don Cheadle and British actress Sophie Okonedo, made £507, 596 in its first week of nationwide release. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby re-entered the charts at number eight, following its recent success at the Oscars. Two other new entries, a remake of the 1965 film Flight of the Phoenix, and the teen comedy Harold and Kumar Get The Munchies, debuted outside the top 10.
