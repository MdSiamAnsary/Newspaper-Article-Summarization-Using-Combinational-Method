China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds. The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next," said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant. The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China.
