US phone company SBC Communications said it expects to cut around 12,800 jobs following its $16bn (Â£8. SBC said 5,125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies. Another 1,700 will go from its sales department, 3,400 from business operations and 2,600 across legal, advertising and public relations. The deal will be financed with $15bn of shares as well as a $1bn special dividend paid to AT&T shareholders. It effectively marks the end of AT&T, which was founded in 1875 by telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell and is one of the US's best-known companies. SBC and AT&T said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger.
