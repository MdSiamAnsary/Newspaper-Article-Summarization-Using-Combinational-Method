Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel has seen sales fall in the face of the upsurge in European low-cost airlines. "The impact of the development of no-frills airlines is being felt ever more strongly," said chief executive Jean-Louis Raymond. Income from its vehicle-carrying shuttle services fell 7%, although 15% more passengers meant a 2% rise in railway revenue. The cross-Channel truck market is improving, Eurotunnel said, but warned that it was not benefiting since much of the traffic was in containers destined for ports. The passenger-only trains which use the tunnel are run by a separate company, Eurostar. But the BBC's business editor, Jeff Randall, said the banks could yet step in and take over altogether.
