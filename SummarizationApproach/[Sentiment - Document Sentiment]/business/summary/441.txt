The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7. 5% rise in exports outside the European Union. According to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was £3. Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3. 8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of £27. The deficit for goods alone was £4. 9bn worth of goods, but imported £21. The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36. November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. 5%, with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars, consumer durables and chemicals. The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0. The country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1. 5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months.
