Algeria suffered a weekend of violent protests against government plans to raise gas prices, local press reports. Demonstrators took to the streets last week when the cost change was first announced, but police seemed to have restored order. El Watan said that a number of hot spots centred on the villages and towns close to Bouira, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital Algiers. Among the other main areas affected were the western Tiaret region and Sidi Ammar in the east of the country, Agence France Presse (AFP) reported. Butane gas and fuel oil are used as the main source of fuel to heat homes and cook food in Algeria's remote mountain areas.
