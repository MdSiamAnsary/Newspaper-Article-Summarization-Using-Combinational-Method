Spain's Football Federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach Luis Aragones over racist comments about Thierry Henry. The federation had initially declined to take action against Aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in October. But its president Angel Maria Villar changed his mind after a request by Spain's anti-violence commission. Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry's Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive. " England's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month. Spain's minister of sport Jaime Lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the Federation's decision.
