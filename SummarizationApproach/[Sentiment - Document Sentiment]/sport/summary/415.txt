England will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew. "Jonny's not fit yet," Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live. England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France. Goal-kickers Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them. "They've probably got two of the best English kickers in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley," added Andrew, a former England fly-half and goal-kicker. " Andrew also blamed England's poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations," he said. " Meanwhile, former England full-back Dusty Hare put England's mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness. "Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate," Hare told BBC Radio Five Live. " Hodgson, who has an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.
