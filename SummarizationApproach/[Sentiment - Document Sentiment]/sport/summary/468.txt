Tim Henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Argentine David Nalbandian at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament on Wednesday. The British number one will next play Roger Federer at the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday. The world number one beat Gaston Gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4, before Andre Agassi saw off Chilean Olympic gold medalist Nicolas Massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). Andy Roddick beat Ivan Ljubicic, who replaced Paradorn Srichaphan, 6-1 6-4. But the Briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the Argentine. "Beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year. " Henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. "I'm not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn't do anything," said Henman. " Federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 French Open champion Gaudio, but was content with his game. " Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months.
