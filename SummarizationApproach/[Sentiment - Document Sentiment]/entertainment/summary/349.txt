India has ordered the deportation of Iranian-born model and actress Negar Khan to Norway after saying she was working illegally on her visa. Khan has had raunchy roles in music videos and Bollywood films over the past two years. The distressed actress told media she was being driven straight to the airport after a routine appointment at the Bombay immigration office. Khan told an Indian news channel on her mobile phone: "They are not even letting me go home to get my bags. " Bipin Bihari, deputy police chief in Bombay, said Khan was being sent back to Norway, from which she holds a passport, on the first available flight. "We issued notices last year, in view of which she had gone back to Norway, but she has returned again this year to work. " One of Khan's biggest successes was the steamy Hindi song Chadti Jawani (Rising Youth).
