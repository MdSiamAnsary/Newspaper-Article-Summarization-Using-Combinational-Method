More than 1,000 people turned out on Sunday to pay tribute to late US TV presenter Johnny Carson in the Nebraska town where he grew up. Carson, who hosted the Tonight Show for 30 years, died on 23 January from respiratory disease emphysema. Old school friends were among the crowd at the school's Johnny Carson Theater. His donations included $600,000 to Norfolk High School in the 1980s to build a new performing arts centre.
