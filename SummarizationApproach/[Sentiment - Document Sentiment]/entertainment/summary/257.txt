Proposals to open a museum dedicated to Jimi Hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father. Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist. "The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix's house," said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation. The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved. Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre. "We never said, 'You can own this property,'" said John Franklin, chief of its operations department. " Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle's central district, where Hendrix grew up.
