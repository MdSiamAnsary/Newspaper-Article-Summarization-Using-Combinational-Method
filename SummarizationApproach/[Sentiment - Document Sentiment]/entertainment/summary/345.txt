Pop star Britney Spears has attacked "false" and "desperate" US tabloid magazines, questioning their honesty after they reported she was pregnant. In a letter on her website, the singer named celebrity tabloids Us Weekly, In Touch and Star as the worst offenders. Stories about the state of her marriage to Kevin Federline and rumours about a pregnancy have recently appeared. In February, Spears clashed with Us Weekly for publishing pictures of her honeymoon in Fiji without permission. The couple, who married in Los Angeles last September, claimed staff took photographs of them which were later sold.
