Rock star Patti Smith has been made artistic director of this year's Meltdown festival, to be held at London's South Bank Centre in June. The punk pioneer follows Morrissey, David Bowie and Nick Cave in directing 15 days of concerts and events. The 58-year-old US singer of Because the Night told The Observer newspaper that the festival would be her response to these "material, exploitative and greedy times". Last year's Meltdown festival, directed by the ex-Smiths star Morrissey, included appearances by singer Jane Birkin, Nancy Sinatra and playwright Alan Bennett.
