UK consumers are the biggest music buyers in the world, according to new figures released on Tuesday by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). But global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004, with growing sales in DVD music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets. The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. Around 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1. "A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans' demand for great music," said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. However, some markets in Continental Europe and Asia - notably Sweden, Finland, France, Spain and South Korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. "On the positive side digital sales are booming," said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI). "The priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts. " "The main choice today's music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally," added Mr Jameson.
