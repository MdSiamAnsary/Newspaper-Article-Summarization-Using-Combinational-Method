US musical Sweet Charity has cancelled its run on Broadway after poor ticket sales for its early shows. Star Christina Applegate had to pull out of pre-Broadway performances earlier this month with a broken foot. Applegate, who starred in TV comedy Married With Children, had been hoping to make her Broadway debut in the show. Sweet Charity tells the story of Charity Hope Valentine, a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man.
