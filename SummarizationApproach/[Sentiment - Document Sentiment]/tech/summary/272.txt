Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game. The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected. While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks. The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild. Instead it browses computer networks for PCs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines. The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds.
