A group of artists in Poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on Nintendo's handheld GameBoy console to a new level. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed "blip-pop. " Think of it as Donkey Kong meets Norman Cook, or maybe Tetris takes on Kraftwerk. All the sounds are made by six Nintendo GameBoys, with a mixture of older models and newer Advance SP handhelds. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board. Jarek Kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now. "I was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine," said Kujda. Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise. "We have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like Commodore, Atari, Spectrum," he said. " The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year. A GameBoy Advance costs about US $200 in Poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most Polish gamers, or musicians.
