Computer giant IBM says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community. The patents include software for a range of practices, including text recognition and database management. Traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite IBM's announcement the company continues to follow this route. IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: "True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. "Our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how IBM will manage intellectual property. " In the past, IBM has supported the non-commercial operating system Linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine Microsoft. Adam Jollans, IBM's world-wide Linux strategy manager, said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation. " Mr Jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration. " Stuart Cohen, chief executive of US firm Open Source Development Labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial. "Let's put this into perspective: We're talking aboutroughly one percent of IBM's worldwide patent portfolio. IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents. Open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code - the origins of the program - for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software.
