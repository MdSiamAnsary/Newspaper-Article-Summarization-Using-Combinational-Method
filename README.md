## Newspaper Article Summarization Using Combinational Method

Experimental Approach for **Newspaper Article Summarization** based on the following criteria.  
- Interconnection of sentences using **TextRank** algorithm
- Prioritization of sentences of sentiment polarity similar to overall document sentiment 
- Primacy of sentences with category-wise keywords

Based on the approach, a simple application has been developed with Python. For implementation purposes, different online resources (e.g. packages and datasets) have been used. 

The work has been done for the final semester projectwork for my **Master in Information Technology** degree at [Institute of Information Technology](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/) of University of Dhaka. The [report](https://github.com/MdSiamAnsary/Newspaper-Article-Summarization-Using-Combinational-Method/blob/main/201103%20_%20Md%20Siam%20Ansary%20(Newspaper%20Article%20Summarizer)%20-%20MIT%2022%20Batch.pdf) of the project with the [supervisor's approval](https://github.com/MdSiamAnsary/Newspaper-Article-Summarization-Using-Combinational-Method/blob/main/201103%20_%20MIT%20Project%20Final%20Presentation%20Approval.pdf) can be found in this reporsitory. 

## Demo Video
A demo video [[LINK](https://github.com/MdSiamAnsary/Newspaper-Article-Summarization-Using-Combinational-Method/tree/main/Demo%20Video)] of the application can be found in the reporsitory.
